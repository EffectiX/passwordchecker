# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/effectix/passwordchecker).

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your pull-request won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests or existing tests do not pass.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date and consistent.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option and deserves all the wrist-slaps.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests. Please.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, **please** [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


**Happy coding**!
